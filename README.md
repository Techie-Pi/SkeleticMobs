# Skeletic Mobs

This plugin is not intended to be used in a server to the public, since this is a personal challenge that I set myself that consisted of making a relatively functional plugin in a week, and after several days thinking about how I was going to do it, what I was going to do ... this idea came up (which is a combination between an idea originally given by my supporter and an old project), the goal of this plugin is to turn all mobs into skeletons, right now there are hardly any mobs and many of them have bugs, besides that for example, loot tables are not changed or raids do not work properly
